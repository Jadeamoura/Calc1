# AND101 Project 4 - Calc1

Submitted by: **Jade Cook**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Calc1** is a simple utility Android app that helps users calculate tips based on a bill amount and a tip percentage. Users input their bill, enter the desired tip %, and the app instantly calculates the tip amount and total bill. This project demonstrates handling user input, button interaction, and displaying calculated output.

## Notes

- This project taught me how to process numeric input safely in Kotlin using `.toDoubleOrNull()` and handle invalid input gracefully.
- I learned how to use **ViewBinding** to simplify referencing UI elements without `findViewById()`.
- I also gained more practice with `ConstraintLayout` for organizing UI components.
